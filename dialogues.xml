      <t>Couldn't rightly say. He said only a {marked} could activate them {relics}, that's why he needed the power.</t>
    </ds>

      <t>He must have a sponsor on the {council}. But I can't figure out which {immortal} would want to see the {council} abolished.</t>

      <t>{rebelleader}'s been the head of {rebel-faction} for the last decade. Very secretive, that one.&lt;page&gt;He's got some trainin', I can tell. I only saw him fight the one time, but he knew what he was about. Kinda like you, I guess.</t>

    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-12" s="Necro">
      <t>I will fabricate a protective talisman, a powerful amulet to neutralize the dark energies coursing through her.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-13" s="Hero">
      <t>And this amulet of yours will cure her?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-14" s="Necro">
      <t>No. Her condition is too critical for an outright cure at this stage.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-15" s="Necro">
      <t>The amulet will suppress the dark energy for a time... if her strength holds, up to a year I'd say.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-16" s="Hero">
      <t>And after that?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-17" s="Necro">
      <t>She'll revert to the state she's in right now. Or degenerate even further. Yes, most likely the latter.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-18" s="Necro">
      <t>But let's worry about that later. First, I must fashion the amulet to counteract the immediate danger.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-19" s="Necro">
      <t>This working won't be some parlor trick, mind. The spell will require a certain rare component, an {ancient-bone}.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1A-20" s="Necro">
      <t>There is good news amidst the gloom, however! In a nearby graveyard, a burying ground for beasts, I'm sure you will find a specimen.&lt;page&gt;Unfortunately, the graveyard is not the quiet resting place one might hope for.

      <t>I took note of that myself, but leave it aside for the time being.&lt;page&gt;I was informed you invoked the {color=term}right of self-defense in the face of mortal danger{color=base} as a means of skirting our earlier prohibition against interfering with any of the {marked}.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-18" s="Immortal1">
      <t>An accurate, if creative, interpretation of the law.
And from what I know of this {lord}, I have no doubt your claim was justified.</t>

    <ds dn="S2-23" s="Immortal1">
      <t>You must have noticed in recent years how the {arbiters} and the {council} have grown progressively... less effective.&lt;page&gt;{Immortal2}, {Immortal3} and myself have attempted to take things in hand, to correct the current course, but it seems as though our efforts have been constantly stymied.</t>

    <ds dn="S2-24" s="Immortal1">
      <t>Though I have been unable to uncover the guilty party hindering our work, the trail circles back to the {council} itself.&lt;page&gt;The protection afforded this unsavory {lord} character is but one more sign that things have gone terribly awry.
And I suspect it is part of a greater, more sinister plan.</t>

      <t>I need an ally, {hero}.&lt;page&gt;As a {marked}, you will no longer be bound by the law.&lt;page&gt;You will be free to pursue {lord} and investigate the situation in any fashion you see fit.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-33" s="Immortal1">
      <t>And once the conspirators are brought to justice, the {council} will have a worthy member to fill the void of {immortal2} stepping down.</t>

      <t>With the {Mark} upon you, the {Relic} will confer some of its energy to you. Visit the relics at all four {temples} and return to {illuster}.&lt;page&gt;That, in essence, is what the Pilgrimage entails.</t>

    <ds dn="S2-40" s="Immortal1">
      <t>Oh, and keep your wits about you during your journey.&lt;page&gt;I have a feeling some skullduggery is afoot within the Pilgrimage, and you don't get to be my age without listening to your hunches.</t>

      <t>Well. With the man dead, I suppose there's no need for secrecy anymore.&lt;page&gt;He was an informant. He and I both reported to the same {Immortal}.&lt;page&gt;He was spying on {Lord} for us. Our boss suspected that {Lord}'s trail would lead back to corruption within the {Council}.</t>

      <t>Relax, both of you. {hunter}'s conscription into the service of an {arbiter} overrules any judgment she would normally face.</t>

      <t>Even the judgment of the {council}?</t>

    <ds dn="S2AB-11" s="immortal7">
      <t>What kind of a question is that? How could I guess at this reprobate's motives!&lt;page&gt;Possibly it's some side effect of her being {marked}.
We all know the Pilgrimage is a chaotic time.</t>

    <ds dn="S2AB-14" s="Hero">
      <t>Of course.
We were on the last leg of the Pilgrimage, on our way to {mapname-kawacity}, when we were ambushed.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-15" s="Hero">
      <t>We had eliminated a few of the assassins and the tide had begun to turn our way, when {immortal7} appeared.&lt;page&gt;He complained that his lackeys were taking too long, and joined the fray himself. As you can see, he failed.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-16" s="immortal7">
      <t>What despicable lies! Better for you to confess, {arbiter}. My integrity-</t>

      <t>{immortal7}!
You know the protocol for these proceedings.
You had your say, now let the {herotitle} speak.</t>

      <t>...</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-19" s="immortal1" p="5">
      <t>That is a grievous accusation, {hero}. What reasons could drive {immortal7} to attempt to murder you and your team?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-20" s="Hero">
      <t>A fair question, {immortal1}.&lt;page&gt;During our recent travels, we discovered that bandits who had sacked a number of towns in the region were working hand-in-hand with {arbiters}.&lt;page&gt;We later learned they were taking their marching orders directly from {immortal7}. I myself was present and witnessed as much with my own eyes.&lt;page&gt;He was willing to do anything in his power to ensure this information never reached the {council}.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-21" s="immortal7" p="2">
      <t>Nonsense! Lies! All of it.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-22" s="immortal1">
      <t>These are very serious claims, {hero}.&lt;page&gt;This cannot be decided solely on the testimony of an {arbiter}, especially when the other party is an {immortal}.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-23" s="immortal1">
      <t>The {council} will investigate the claims on both sides and render a judgment.&lt;page&gt;Considering the gravity of the matter, it may take quite a long while to come to a decision.</t>

    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-25.5" s="Partner">

    <ds dn="S2AB-26" s="Apprentice" p="3">
      <t>I don't understand.
{immortal1} made it clear they wouldn't trust our word against {immortal7}'s. And yet... they're just letting us go?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-27" s="Partner">
      <t>A child could see {immortal7} was lying, and badly, but obviously the {council} can't punish him based on nothing but our word.</t>

      <t>But why let us go?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-29" s="Partner">
      <t>{Immortal1} made it clear the {council}'s deliberations would be quite lengthy.&lt;page&gt;Giving us ample time to complete the Pilgrimage. Once the Pilgrimage is complete, {hero} can be selected as an {immortal}.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2AB-29.5" s="Hero">

      <t>Not a bad result, all things considered.&lt;page&gt;Simply surviving an assault from an {immortal} is a small miracle in itself, but walking away afterwards with the {council}'s blessing tops even that.</t>

      <t>{mapname-town2} was attacked by some very determined bandits just a few days ago.

With their help, the attack was quickly routed.</t>

      <t>What's "{rebel-faction}"?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S1Cut-5" s="Partner">
      <t>A group of malcontents who oppose the rule of the {immortals}. They want everything to go back to the way it was before the {immortal-council}.&lt;page&gt;You wouldn't have heard about them in the capital. They dare not show their faces there, for obvious reasons. Involving all-powerful beings.&lt;page&gt;Though they've been active for decades, {rebel-faction}'s cause has never been popular. Until recently. New leadership, I heard.</t>
    </ds>

      <t>Some people are unhappy with the rule of the {immortals}.&lt;page&gt;With the right leaders, a dissident group like {rebel-faction} can quickly become a threat.</t>

      <t>I have deciphered the function of the device {goodarbiter} delivered to the {council}.&lt;page&gt;It siphons energy from the {relics}, but for what purpose I cannot yet say.&lt;page&gt;I believe by using this device on {apprentice}, we should be able to remove the dark energy she so carelessly absorbed.

      <t>The dark energy has left your body, but whatever changes you experienced will remain.&lt;page&gt;I suggest you take this as a lesson not to fiddle with powerful artifacts you cannot possibly understand...&lt;page&gt;Though I admit this ordeal seems only to have left you stronger in the end.</t>

      <t>The feeling is mutual, but I intend to stick around for a while yet.&lt;page&gt;I'd like to continue my evaluation of {apprentice}, to ensure her recovery is complete.

      <t>As this situation only occurs about once a century, it will be a mystery to most of you.&lt;page&gt;When an {immortal}'s time has come, a replacement is selected through a method called the {marked} Pilgrimage.</t>

    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-2" s="immortal2">
      <t>Treachery, {immortal1}? Hardly. Our system of governance is flawed, the {council} itself corrupted, and worms like {immortal7} can become {immortals}.&lt;page&gt;What is needed is a single, righteous hand to guide the world, to mold and control it. I will achieve what the {council} has failed to do, what we've always wanted: order.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-3" s="immortal1">
      <t>Have you gone mad, {immortal2}?&lt;page&gt;The {council} was formed to avoid just this sort of situation. The concentration of so much power in the control of a single {immortal} is far too dangerous!&lt;page&gt;You yourself argued that very point, most vehemently, after we bound {ancient-beast} to its prison so long ago.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-4" s="immortal2">
      <t>A regrettable mistake. I should have seized control back then, rather than share it with a group of indecisive fools.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-5" s="immortal1">
      <t>Do you hear what you're saying, old friend?&lt;page&gt;You know the signs as well as I do. The dark energy we have endured for so long is corrupting you from within, breaking down your reason.&lt;page&gt;Is this not why you chose to step down, to finally be rid of this curse? I too am weary of it, old friend. I would not be far behind you...</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-6" s="immortal2">
      <t>For a great sage, you were always a bit slow, {immortal1}.&lt;page&gt;I stepped down in order to bring about the Pilgrimage, through which my agents could gain access to the {temple} {relics}.&lt;page&gt;Their vast power I have absorbed already. Only this last remains.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-7" s="immortal1">
      <t>And so you will have amassed every ounce of {ancient-beast}'s power. Are you truly so blind to its corruption? In one way or another, it will destroy you.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-8" s="immortal2">
      <t>No! I control the darkness. I overcame its corrupting influence long ago! I am my own master- It holds no sway- This is all for...&lt;page&gt;The greater good.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="S2-9" s="EvilKawa">
      <t>Master {immortal2}, we haven't time for this bickering!&lt;page&gt;The others still hope to stop your great plan. You must drain the final {relic} so that we may bring forth the utopia you have worked so hard to achieve!</t>
    </ds>

      <t>That's why it was necessary to bind it to the {relics}.&lt;page&gt;We knew we must continuously siphon its power to keep it in check. And that it would take a toll on us, a severe toll.</t>

      <t>Hmm... When news reached us of the {marked} coming here for the Pilgrimage, a few {rebel-faction} sympathizers flooded the {sealed-temple}.</t>

      <t>Hmm... Living underground, we {Bzils} are quite knowledgeable about tunnel networks and reservoirs and such things.&lt;page&gt;We believe {rebels} diverted the flow of an underground river, raising the water level until the entire {temple} was submerged.</t>

 {hero} knows the law letter-by-letter.&lt;page&gt;There is a provision related to the {arbiters}' right of self-defense which supersedes all other laws, even those pertaining to the {markeds}.&lt;page&gt;By sending those ruffians after us, {lord} has given us legal grounds to bring him to justice, regardless of his {marked} status.</t>

      <t>Say, do you mind if I tag along with you for now?&lt;page&gt;If this {lord} is the culprit, I'll be in a better position to deal with him with an armed escort at my back.&lt;page&gt;And if he isn't...&lt;page&gt;I heard you were the {arbiter} who arrested him on charges of murder before the {immortals} saw fit to make him a {marked}.

      <t>{arbiter} {partner} has told us you come with questions on how to seal Ancient Beast.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-7" s="Hero">
      <t>Yes, elders.
We recovered the original {medallion} that was used to summon {ancient-beast} into {worldname}.&lt;page&gt;{immortal1} told us we could use it once again to seal the beast, and that your people might know the method.&lt;page&gt;But he feared the knowledge might be lost to you?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-8" s="ElderKawa2">
      <t>Not all lost.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-8.5" s="ElderKawa3">
      <t>Silly {immortals}.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-9" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>Our knowledge of summoning rituals has greatly diminished since the days of old, but some of the ancient lore yet remains.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-10" s="Apprentice" p="3">
      <t>Really? That's great!&lt;page&gt;But {immortal1} was convinced the {council}'s prohibition on summoning meant your people would have lost this knowledge.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-12" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>Our summoning magic is not like {human} magic, to be taught and learned. It is more like innate ability with {kawas}.&lt;page&gt;{council} prohibition did cause techniques to be lost, but Sealing Ritual is simple one.</t>

      <t>I do not wish to question the wisdom of the esteemed elders, but are you certain that is all?&lt;page&gt;With an entity as powerful as {ancient-beast}, the ritual must require some form of cata-</t>

      <t>{necro}, cease your rudeness!

      <t>...</t>
    </ds>

      <t>Ah.
I think I understand now.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-21" s="Necro">
      <t>My apologies, {partner}. It was my mistake.
Elders, please proceed.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-22" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>That is... all there is to it.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-23" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>Keep in mind, this will only seal {ancient-beast} away again. Which means {immortals} will still be needed to siphon dark energy from Seal, to keep it contained.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-24" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>And whole situation could very well repeat itself one day.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-25" s="Hunter">
      <t>I know this bloke {immortal1} said the beast couldn't be defeated, but couldn't we just give it a good wallopin' and see what happens?&lt;page&gt;After all, we defeated {primus} and his flunkies where the other {immortals} failed.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-26" s="ElderKawa2">
      <t>Not possible.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-27" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>{immortal1} is most certainly correct that {ancient-beast} cannot be defeated.&lt;page&gt;Such big summoning as Ancient Beast would have created permanent connection between {worldname} and {ancient-beast}'s terrible realm.&lt;page&gt;Even if beast's physical form were defeated, beast life energy would retreat to home realm and regenerate.&lt;page&gt;After short span, beast would return to {worldmapname} to terrorize all again.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-28" s="Hero">
      <t>Then there really is no other way?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-noway-1" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>If there is other way, it is beyond our ken.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-noway-1.5" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>But, if there was something, it would be connected to {mapname-highlands02}, where {ancient-beast} was summoned, long ago.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-noway-1.6" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>Just a guess at this point, though.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-noway-2" s="Partner" p="5">
      <t>In that case we will all do what we must, and hope that the next generation of {immortals} is more prudent.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-noway-3" s="Hero">
      <t>All right everyone. This is our most important duty yet. Prepare yourselves.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-1" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>Well... There *might* be another way.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-2" s="Partner" p="3">
      <t>What, really?
You might have mentioned that earlier when we, uh-&lt;page&gt;Right. Let's hear it.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-3" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>{color=story}{key-henges}{color=base} you possess might just be key.&lt;page&gt;Area from which they came, {mapname-highlands02}, is nexus of power where {ancient-beast} was summoned long ago.&lt;page&gt;Portal there could be activated with fragments and then used to enter {ancient-beast}'s realm.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-4" s="Apprentice" p="3">
      <t>But isn't {ancient-beast} here in {worldname} now? Why travel to its home realm?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-5" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>You would not go there immediately.
But if you defeat beast in battle and life energy returns to beast realm...&lt;page&gt;At that point, you could use portal to follow and dispatch for good.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-6" s="Partner">
      <t>Simple.&lt;page&gt;But what's the catch?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-7" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>"Catch" was finding {color=story}{key-henges}{color=base}, as fragments thought lost.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-7.5" s="kairu">
      <t>That's it?! Where I'm from, the elders would insist we gather a wagonload of ancient artefacts before trying to take down such a beast.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-8" s="ElderKawa2">
      <t>And need one more thing!</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-9" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>You need an {color=story}{key-boss}{color=base} from {ancient-beast} itself, to connect the portal to beast realm.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-10" s="Hero">
      <t>How would we go about getting that?</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-11" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>We're not entirely certain.
It must come from beast itself, so you'll need to acquire it during fighting beast.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-12" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>Once beast is defeated and you have {color=story}{key-boss}{color=base}, head for {mapname-highlands02} and activate portal.&lt;page&gt;If all goes well, you will be able to end {ancient-beast}'s threat for good.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-12.5" s="ElderKawa1">
      <t>We would accompany you, but I fear we're a little past our prime. And fighting was never strong suit to begin with.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s3-yesway-13" s="Hero">

      <t>Decades ago, a young woman stood on the stoop of her family home, seeing her beloved off to battle.&lt;page&gt;She grasped her locket against her breast. A symbol of their devotion, it was an exact match for the piece hanging around her beloved's neck.&lt;page&gt;Drawing a ragged breath of the icy air, she bid him farewell.&lt;page&gt;Faithfully, she awaited his return. Long days of waiting turned to months, months grew into a year, and finally several lonely years passed. But he did not return.&lt;page&gt;After all this time, a letter arrived, explaining that though her beloved had fought valiantly, he had fallen in combat.&lt;page&gt;However faithful and patient she had been, he would never return.&lt;page&gt;The woman fell into a deep despair. She spent her days alone, sitting in darkness, their old home made a prison by her loss.&lt;page&gt;But one evening, after the gloom had displaced the sun, she heard a voice. It was her lover's voice, calling to her from the locket, and bidding her to join him.&lt;page&gt;Mesmerized by the voice, and wanting nothing more than to be reunited with her beloved, she grasped the locket to her breast again and set out into the night to find him.</t>

      <t>It seems as if {immortal2} is the one ultimately pulling the strings. If that's the case, I don't think we can trust his motives.&lt;page&gt;And I definitely don't agree with his methods.</t>

      <t>{immortal2} set everything in motion by initiating the {marked} Pilgrimage in the first place.&lt;page&gt;That he is absorbing the dark energy {rebel-faction} has been collecting points directly to {immortal2} being the mastermind.</t>
    </ds>
    <ds dn="s2-34" s="Hero">
      <t>And that aside from the fact an {immortal} should not have been able to enter the {temple}.&lt;page&gt;That he had enough power to force his way in must mean he has already absorbed the energy from the other {relics}. He's been planning this betrayal from the start.</t>
