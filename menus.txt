; Difficulty Settings
difficulty-preset-title		=Difficulty Presets
difficulty-preset-0     	=Casual
difficulty-preset-0-desc	=If you want mostly to focus on the story and not worry overmuch about winning encounters, this is the mode for you.
difficulty-preset-1     	=Beginner
difficulty-preset-1-desc	=This is the recommended mode if you are new to tactical RPGs, or just haven't played one in a while.
difficulty-preset-2     	=Veteran
difficulty-preset-2-desc	=This is the default setting. It is recommended for players with a solid amount of experience playing Tactical RPGs. WARNING: this mode can be fairly difficult and might not be for everyone!
difficulty-preset-3     	=Hard
difficulty-preset-3-desc	=If you want things to be a little harder. The biggest difference is that it will be harder to out-level the enemies and they will be a little stronger than you at a comparable level.
difficulty-preset-4     	=Very Hard
difficulty-preset-4-desc	=This should be a fairly good challenge. The enemies will always scale with your level and will have access to the full complement of items. They might even get them earlier than you, if you're leveling a lot.
difficulty-preset-5     	=Custom
difficulty-preset-5-desc	=This lets you customize the individual options exactly as you want them.

difficulty-injurystyle-title	=Injury System
difficulty-injurystyle-0     	=None
difficulty-injurystyle-0-desc	=There are no penalties when a character falls in combat. This is not recommended unless you feel things are just too hard.
difficulty-injurystyle-1     	=AP Malus
difficulty-injurystyle-1-desc	=When a character falls in combat, they will earn less {AP} at the end of the battle. Falling multiple times will further reduce that amount. This is a good alternative to the regular {injury} system if you really don't want to ever bench anyone.
difficulty-injurystyle-2     	=Default
difficulty-injurystyle-2-desc	=This is the default {injury} system. When a character falls in combat, they will have a penalty to all their stats until they rest for a full battle. Resting means you won't deploy them during an encounter. This setting encourages the player to create a few substitute units.
difficulty-injurystyle-3     	=Permanent
difficulty-injurystyle-3-desc	={Injuries} are permanent and will never heal. Each {injury} will give the character -{injury-perm-penalty}% to a random stat. This is only recommended if you want a greater challenge.
difficulty-injurystyle-4     	=Permadeath
difficulty-injurystyle-4-desc	={Injuries} are permanent and give -{injury-perm-penalty}% to a random stat. Once a character has gotten {injury-perm-max} {injuries}, they will be unable to participate in combat anymore. Story characters (other than the main character) are not exempt from this. Most people should probably not use this option.

difficulty-randomnumbers-title	=Random Numbers
difficulty-randomnumbers-0		=Default
difficulty-randomnumbers-0-desc	=The game uses a simple 1-100 roll, just like rolling a d100. This is roughly as “true” of a random system as you can get in a video game.
difficulty-randomnumbers-1		=Weighted
difficulty-randomnumbers-1-desc	=The game will use a randomizing system that's more in the player's favor.

difficulty-levelscaling-title	=Enemies Level Scaling
difficulty-levelscaling-0     	=Default
difficulty-levelscaling-0-desc	=This is the recommended setting. Each map has a minimum and maximum level range for enemies, so they will try to keep up with your level. But if you're struggling, you could raise your level to pass theirs and thus overpower your foes.
difficulty-levelscaling-1     	=Max Up
difficulty-levelscaling-1-desc	=Each map has a minimum and maximum level range for enemies, but the maximum range is increased by {scaling-maxup}%, so it will be harder for you to pass their level. This is a good option if you tend to run a lot of optional battles and want to make sure the enemies have a chance to keep up with you.
difficulty-levelscaling-2     	=No Max
difficulty-levelscaling-2-desc	=Each map has a minimum level for enemies, but they will always scale with your level, with no maximum. This is a good option if you want to level as much as you want and never worry about the enemies being too low level. But it means you can't ever overpower them with raw levels either.

difficulty-powerlevel-0     	=-25% Stats
difficulty-powerlevel-0-desc	=Enemies will have -25% to their stats ({ATK}, {MND}, {DEF}, {RES}) . This should make things quite a bit easier.
difficulty-powerlevel-1     	=-10% Stats
difficulty-powerlevel-1-desc	=Enemies will have -10% to their stats ({ATK}, {MND}, {DEF}, {RES}). This should make things easier.
difficulty-powerlevel-2     	=-5% Stats
difficulty-powerlevel-2-desc	=Enemies will have -5% to their stats ({ATK}, {MND}, {DEF}, {RES}). If you want that small extra edge.
difficulty-powerlevel-3     	=Default
difficulty-powerlevel-3-desc	=Enemies will have the stats a character of their level would normally have. For the most part, these are the same stats you would have if you'd leveled your character in their current class almost exclusively.
difficulty-powerlevel-4     	=+5% Stats
difficulty-powerlevel-4-desc	=Enemies will have +5% to their stats ({ATK}, {MND}, {DEF}, {RES}). If you want things a little harder.
difficulty-powerlevel-5     	=+10% Stats

difficulty-powerlevel-9     	=+50% Stats
difficulty-powerlevel-9-desc	=Enemies will have +50% to their stats ({ATK}, {MND}, {DEF}, {RES}). It's probably not a good idea to use this. Encounters won't be properly balanced in general.

difficulty-specialenemies-0-desc=The game will use the default enemies.
difficulty-specialenemies-1     =Yes
difficulty-specialenemies-1-desc=In some encounters, one or more enemies will be replaced by a special version of the enemy, with more abilities. This a different and more interesting way to raise the difficulty than simply increasing enemy stats.

difficulty-revives-common		=Enemies will sometimes revive other fallen enemies. They have decreasing odds of doing so the more often a target has died.
difficulty-revives-title		=Enemies use Revive
difficulty-revives-0			=None
difficulty-revives-0-desc		=Enemies will never revive other fallen enemies (unless it's part of the encounter).

difficulty-revives-3			=More
difficulty-revives-3-desc		={difficulty-revives-common} They have a high maximum amount of times they can do this per battle. This could lead to significantly lengthier battles if you're not careful.

difficulty-itemusage-2     		=Many
difficulty-itemusage-2-desc		=Enemies will have access to as many items as you do, although they might have access to higher tiers faster than you if you're leveling faster than normal. This is more challenging.

difficulty-extragear-title		=Enemies Gear
difficulty-extragear-0     		=Less
difficulty-extragear-0-desc		=Enemies will have 1 less piece gear than normal on average. This should make things fairly easier, while being more randomized than simply dropping their stats by a set amount.
difficulty-extragear-1     		=Default
difficulty-extragear-1-desc		=Enemies will have a fair amount of gear on their person. They usually won't grab all the accessories they can, but they should otherwise mostly wear as much as they can once the story picks up.
difficulty-extragear-2     		=More
difficulty-extragear-2-desc		=Enemies will have 1 more piece of gear than normal on average. This should make things a bit harder.
difficulty-extragear-3     		=Full
difficulty-extragear-3-desc		=Enemies will fill every equipment slot they can. This means they'll wear as much gear as they can and fill the rest with various accessories. This might increase the challenge in unforeseen ways at times.

difficulty-enemyskills-title	=Enemies Passives/Counter
difficulty-enemyskills-0		=Less
difficulty-enemyskills-0-desc	=Enemies will have a chance of spawning without passives or counters, even if they are high enough level.
difficulty-enemyskills-1		=Default
difficulty-enemyskills-1-desc	=Enemies will always spawn with passives and counters if their level is high enough.

newgameplus-option-7		=Levels
newgameplus-option-7-desc	=All units will keep their current {generic-level}. Story units will only rejoin once the story is advanced enough. It is recommended to use "{difficulty-levelscaling-2}" for the difficulty setting "{difficulty-levelscaling-title}", otherwise enemies' levels will be too low.

newgameplus-option-8		=Enemies' Levels
newgameplus-option-8-desc	=This will set "{difficulty-levelscaling-title}" to "{difficulty-levelscaling-2}" in the Difficulty Options for you, although the value can still be changed from the Difficulty Options as normal.

newgameplus-option-9-desc	=All previous gear will carry over. Also, stores will sell the best gear possible from the start of the game.

newgameplus-option-10		=Enemies' Gear

; Tutorial about Bandit Kawa

popup-tutorial-sideattacks2			=At the end of your turn, you'll get to select your character's facing. Try not to show your back to your enemies, as they will also deal more damage from the sides and the back!

; Tutorial about resetting character level
popup-tutorial-reset-level1		=From this screen, you can select a character and reset their level to 1. This will reset their stats as a level 1 of their current class and leave their {AP} intact.
popup-tutorial-reset-level2		=The main reason to do this is if you're trying to level the character in a very specific combination of classes for their stats growth and you feel you've "messed it up".
popup-tutorial-reset-level3		=In general, it is NOT recommended to reset a character to level 1.{newline}Resetting {hero}'s level will influence the level of other story characters you encounter during the game, which could lead to difficult encounters.

Unless you have special {abilities} that influence what you can equip (like {ASSA-P2} or {MERC-P1}, for example), you can equip 1 weapon, 1 body piece, 1 hat piece, 1 shield (for certain {classes}) and as many accessories as you can fit.

popup-customize-unit1			=You can change the visual appearance of units in this section. By using the left/right arrows on any category, you can quickly change its value, or select the row (click on the row text with the mouse or hit the confirm button) to view a list of possible options.
popup-customize-unit-console1	=You can change the visual appearance of units in this section. By using the {controller-dpad-term} on any category you can quickly change its value, or select the row (press the {button-confirm} button when highlighting a row text) to view a list of possible options.

popup-lowres					=If you find that you can't see as much of the map as you'd like, you can go into the "Options - Graphics" and change the "{options-graphics-pixelperfectBattle}" option to NO.{newline}This will scale the screen so you see the same amount as you would in a higher resolution, but the sprites won't be as crisp.

popup-details-reminder			=You can see the escape zone (and many other points of interest on most maps) by pressing the {button-details} button during your turn.
popup-details-reminder-again	=You can see the target zone for delayed attacks by pressing the {button-details} button during your turn.

popup-save-in-between-battles	=Would you like to save your progress?{newline}{newline}It might be wise to save on a different slot, just in case, since you will resume at the start of the next battle, rather than on the world map with this save data.

popup-telemetry					=The game will send anonymous data about {color=term}errors and about classes and abilities usage{color=base}.{newline}{newline}We're a small team, and this information helps us to find and resolve issues more rapidly, as well as balance the game better.{newline}{newline}The information is entirely anonymous. You will be able to change this setting from the Options as well. Will you allow the game to send anonymous data?
popup-clear-save				=Would you like to save your progress? This will create a save file with the Clear flag on, from right before your battle with {themaw}.
